# About [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] desktop app

The [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager] desktop app connects the [!DNL Experience Manager] DAM repository to your desktop, to provide faster access to resources and streamlined workflows. This reduction-in-effort improves the efficiency of users who work with digital assets in their desktop workflows. Using the app, the assets within [!DNL Experience Manager Assets] are easily accessible on your local desktop and can be used in any desktop applications. You can open and edit the assets in a desktop application of your choice. The local edits can be made available in the [!DNL Experience Manager] DAM repository. Any new assets added to the repository from any source can be made available on your desktop as well.

Such an integration allows various roles in the organization to manage the assets centrally in [!DNL Experience Manager Assets]. Marketers and business users can ensure compliance to the various standards including branding and licensing. Creative users can also access assets on the desktop in the [!DNL Creative Cloud] and other native applications.
