# AEM desktop app Overview {#overview-v2}

Adobe offers connected workflows across its solutions to allow next-level productivity for your creative professionals. The Adobe Experience Manager desktop app connects repositories and desktop applications, including Adobe and third-party ones, to provide faster access to resources and streamlined workflows. This saving of time and reduction in effort improves efficiency of users, who work with assets from Adobe Experience Manager in their desktop workflows.

Using the App, the assets within AEM Assets are easily accessible on your local desktop and can be used in any desktop applications. Assets can be easily revealed in Mac Finder or Windows Explorer, opened in desktop applications, and changed locally - the changes are saved back to AEM with a new version created in the repository.

Such an integration allows various roles in the organization to manage the assets centrally in AEM Assets and to access them in the Creative Cloud and other applications, while making it easy to adhere to the various standards including branding.

>[!NOTE]

## What's New in the App {#whats-new-v2}

Version 2.0 of the app is created from grounds-up to provide many improvements over the previous versions. The new app simplifies access to assets from AEM Assets repository for desktop applications, and provides a way to discover assets, open, edit and upload changes, as well as upload new assets â€“ without requiring the user to use the AEM interface.

The new app brings substantial improvements to the user experience, while catering to the same use cases as before. The following are the top-level improvements.

* Users discover assets by browsing and searching within the app in a built-in browser, instead of relying on Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to display a virtual network share.
* Clear guidance on the actions available to users.
* Performance is improved by reducing bandwidth usage. The original binary files are downloaded only when required. For browsing and searching assets, only small thumbnails are transferred.
* Optimized for bulk operations, such as bulk upload.

The primary use cases and enhancements of the new app are mapped with the customer journey in the following illustration

The desktop app allows you to accomplish all the above-mentioned use cases right from its user interface, allowing for a desktop-only experience. If needed, you can also choose to do asset discovery in the web interface and then initiate Open, Reveal, Edit, and Toggle check-out/check-in flags from the web interface.
