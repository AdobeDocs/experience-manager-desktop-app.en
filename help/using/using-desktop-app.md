# Open assets on your desktop {#openondesktop-v2}

You can open the remote assets for viewing in the native application. The assets are downloaded to a local folder. Then they are launched in the native application associated with the file format. You can change the native application to open specific file types (extensions) in your Mac or Windows.

Click **[!UICONTROL Open]** from the asset menu. The asset is downloaded locally and opened in the native application. Check the download progress and transfer speed of large assets in the status bar.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the expected changes are not reflected in the app, click refresh icon ![Refresh icon](assets/do-not-localize/refresh.png) or right click in the app interface and click **[!UICONTROL Refresh]**. The actions are not available while larger downloads or uploads are in progress.

To open the local download folder of an asset, click ![More actions icon](assets/do-not-localize/more2_da2.png) and click ![Reveal icon](assets/do-not-localize/reveal_action2_da2.png) **[!UICONTROL Reveal File]** action.

## Use or place assets into native documents {#place-assets-in-native-documents}

In some cases, say when placing an asset into a native document, you access a file in Windows Explorer or Mac Finder. To get to the file system location of the locally downloaded file, use the ![Reveal icon](assets/do-not-localize/reveal_action2_da2.png) **[!UICONTROL Reveal File]** option.

Click **[!UICONTROL Reveal File]**, or **[!UICONTROL Reveal Folder]** on a folder, to open Windows Explorer or Mac Finder with the file or folder preselected on your local computer. As an example, the option is useful to place the [!DNL Experience Manager] files in the native applications that support placing or linking local files. To see how to place files in Adobe InDesign, see [Placing graphics](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/placing-graphics.html).

The **[!UICONTROL Reveal File]** action opens a local network share. It displays only the assets that are available locally. That is, it displays assets that were revealed, downloaded, or opened/edited using the app. The local network share does not upload any changes to [!DNL Experience Manager]. To upload the changes, explicitly use the **[!UICONTROL Upload Changes]** or **[!UICONTROL Upload]** actions in the app.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For backwards compatibility with [!DNL Experience Manager] desktop app v1.x, the files revealed are served from a local network share, exposing locally available files only. The desktop paths of the revealed files are the same as the paths created by app v1.x.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Do not use the **[!UICONTROL Reveal File]** option to edit assets in native applications. Instead, use the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** actions. To know more, see [Advanced workflow: collaborate on the same files and avoid editing conflicts](#adv-workflow-collaborate-avoid-conflicts).
