## What is new in the app {#whats-new-v2}

Version 2.0 of the app is created from grounds-up to provide many improvements over the previous versions. The new app is more user-friendly and offers a dedicated desktop experience with a new application UI. Users can discover assets via search or browsing, open, edit, and upload changes, as well as upload new assets - without requiring the user to use the [!DNL Experience Manager] interface. This version also supports opening files from the [!DNL Experience Manager] interface.

The new app brings substantial improvements to the user experience, while catering to the same use cases as before. The following are the top-level improvements.

* Users discover assets by browsing and searching within the app's built-in browser. Doing so eliminates the need to rely on Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to display a virtual network share.
* Clear guidance on the actions available to users.
* Performance is improved by reducing bandwidth usage. The original binary files are downloaded only when necessary. For browsing and searching assets, only small thumbnails are transferred.
* Optimized for bulk operations, such as bulk upload.

The primary use cases and enhancements of the new app are mapped with the customer journey in the following illustration.
